Nothing Left
============

A Global Game Jam 2015 project that can be found [here](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/nothing-left)

The theme was: **"What do We do Now?"**

**The last build can be played at [thamenato.github.io/ggj2015-nothing_left/](http://thamenato.github.io/ggj2015-nothing_left/)**

## The Jam

At the beggining of the Jam, before each team start developing it's own project we had a huge brainstorm and the majority was thinking how to work the theme proposed changing the mechanics of a game, they came up with ideas like:

- Don't let the player know any of the inputs or mess with the "standard" input so the player has to figure it out how to play;
- Or never tell what the player is supposed to do, no clue about what the objective of the game is.

Many other ideas were propposed but my team decided to focus on a "storyteller", something using a story to approach a situation where you work with "What do we do now?", we also wanted to use the following *diversifiers*:

- **This is How it Feels**: *The game raises awareness of how hate speech or unfair accusations feel, and what kind of effect they have on their targets.*

- **Public Domain Class of 2015**: *Make a game based on the works entered to Public Domain on 1st January 2015 - for instance works of Wassily Kandinsky, Edvard Munch, Edith Sitwell, Piet Mondrian, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Felix Nussbaum, Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti, Glenn Miller, Flannery O’Connor, and Ian Fleming (cough, James Bond, cough), depending on your country.*

## Our idea

### Plot

You're depressive, you don't think you could stand one more day living. You wake up, deal with daily situations at your house, at your work, at the park and finally home again and each night, before going to bed you decide if it's worth living one more day.

### Goal

Deal with situations (we call it "events" inside the game) that each day has to offer, all the reactions that will come up from dealing with them are random, they could be something positive or negative to your life: sometimes the cat might scratch you, others it'll purr.

We wanted to simulate how real life can be with us, how unpredicted some actions can be, what you'll do if they happen to you? The player can simply ignore and don't deal with some of them.

Each night, when going to bed, if the character is too depressed, it will end his misery and the game ends.

At the 3rd night if the player managed to not let the character depressed, it'll give life another chance.

### Mechanics

The game has two controllers:
- Disposition: it's the bar that appears on the top left of the screen, each day you have a full disposition to deal with everything that will come up but by interacting with them will consume your disposition so you can't simply go and interact with everything.
- Satisfaction: this can't be seen by the player, it defines how depressed the character is, if it's too low at night, the game will end.

Each event has a tree of possible interactions, you can't know what will come each time you play.

### Controls

- [A] or [Left arrow]: moves to the left;
- [D] or [Right arrow]: moves to the right;
- [Space bar]: action.
